It probably pays to think of my life as a set of backlogs.  The goal
is to not allow any backlog to add up, while my most important
project is the one in which I'm working to actively push back the
backlog.  Many things which seem difficult to quantify feel much more
doable if I think of them in terms of stories in a journal.  For
example, "Love Isaac" is very abstract, but if I can't think of a
unique story about Isaac to write in my journal for the last few days,
my relationship with Isaac is probably in trouble.

So my weight is a perfect example.  Unless it's currently my top
project, I don't necessarily need to lose weight.  (eureka)  Instead,
I need to maintain my current weight.  But goals in a maintenance
phase must be actionable, and I can't immediately lose weight, short
of hacking off limbs.  But I can maintain a different metric, for
example "(Pounds over 172) - (Fasting hours)".  If I gain weight, I
can immediately bump up my fasting hours to compensate.

Another difficult point are things that require dead time.  For
example, I can't keep the number of minutes since I've logged about
Isaac at 0.  One possibility is keeping "number of days (if more than
one) since I've logged about Isaac."  That's a little better, but nor
super.  Now, I guess it's up to me to choose some magic time interval
after which logging about Isaac immediately becomes necessary.
Perhaps better would be to somehow capture the average number of log
entries per (week, month, year).  That way, if I'm doing better this
year than last, I'm still OK, and I could create a project to up that
total.  Again, I would need to choose a perfect interval.  Or, if it's
been 2X days since I started the goal, the measure could be (number of
times I did it in the first X days) - (number of times I've done it in
the last X days).

Of course, part of the goal will be to recognize constraints.
Sleeping is a big concern in a system like this.

And again, how do I manage projects with deadlines?  I recognize them,
make goals out of time worked, and move forward from there, I guess.

OK, so let's brainstorm some goal metrics (some of these are probably projects)

- Time worked for agitar
- Progress toward PhD
- Progress toward September housing
- Unfiled paper in the house
- Neatness of house
- Weight
- Strength
- Sex
- Purity
- Bible reading and praying
- Something about ideas to make my computer easier to use
- Comfort with Marat
- Loving Becca, Ethan, Isaac, Mom, Dad, Becky, Kevin, Joel, Nathan,
  Dana, Mike Jones, Josh Papsdorf, Gil, James Mumma, Raul, Sarah
  Rubel, Rob Thornton, Josh McElhattan, Patrick Philipp, Rick Ross,
  Josh Faey, Steve Fitzgerald, Chris Sawall, Kent Beck, Carlos
  Pacheco, Dan Foley, Joe Scali, Jake Sloan, Mike Liang
- Sorting through the list of people above
- Getting to know Becca's classmates
- Getting to know Agitar colleagues
- Dishes

- Becca's sexiness
- Finances
- System for dealing with all of this
- Loan payments

- Organization of stuff
- Boys' maturity and knowledge
- Correcting addresses
- Ethan's connection with classmates
- Kids are in the right school
- Evangelism?

Most awesome would be a system that worked directly from a journal
like this one: a certain entered symbol would create a goal, another
would indicate the current condition of the goal.  Create a project,
make progress toward a project.  Create a task, complete a task,
rename a task.  Actually, this is awesome, right?  It's a perfect way
to start with something meaningful, keep a full audit of what I'm
doing, and still be able to automate as I move forward.  What do I
need again?

- Have an idea
- Officially start tracking a goal
- Current condition of the goal
- Start working on a project
- Identify next step for a project (which is a task)
- Commit to an independent task
- Do a task
- Finish a project
- Edit a task

That will work for now.  OK, obviously I like to use "-" as a prefix
in my normal writing, so that's out.  Actually, I like the
preprocessor idea from C.  The command character is #.  Only if it is
at the beginning of a line, or the first character within delimiters,
will it count.  So, if \# were #, the following would be good:

\#IDEA: Do something cool

That would be cool (\#IDEA: do it!)

Very nice.  In that case, the command sequences I'm thinking of are:

- #NOW timestamp
- #IDEA plain text
- #START_GOAL id (description should follow)
- #TRACK id: number
- #START_PROJECT id (description should follow)
- #PROGRESS id of goal or project, or task description
- #NEXT_STEP project_id: task description
- #NEW_TASK task description
- #DONE task description or project_id
- #EDIT old description -> new description

Goals and projects have ids because I expect to be typing them a lot.
Tasks don't: they should only come up if edited or done, and I want to
prevent myself from getting too excited about them.  If more
information needs to be added about anything, I should do it under
"PROGRESS" for that item: it's progress to be able to know more than I
did before.

#IDEA: pull in ideas from ideas.txt

Separating ideas from tasks is good.  Things I might do vs. things I
must do.  Goals and projects are a little dodgier, since the
nomenclature is a little odd on goals.  Most of the goals are things I
want to continue doing throughout my life, which I might be "behind"
on in some sense, whereas projects are pushes that I expect to have
limited duration.

Ok, enough fun.  Let's start our first goal.  I want to get to sleep
tonight, but even more, I want the house to be in good shape when
Becca gets here tomorrow, I want to be ready for church and family
camp.  That's it before I go to bed, I think.

#IDEA: Back up this file
#IDEA: Separate journals (professional would be good).  
-- How to combine them?

Emacs automatically continues the # mark on the next line, but ideas
and tasks should be nameable on one line.  The -- underneath to
indicate a quick side though on the line above seems doable--this is
not something that an automated tool should necessarily recognize.
So:

#START_GOAL: Dishes

"Dishes" is BAD (something can be done), WAITING (dishes are drying an
hour), or GOOD (alles gut).

// #TRACK Dishes: bad

#NOW: 2007.07.15 0:20:00
// #TRACK: Dishes: waiting
#NEW_TASK: Insert datestamp with Emacs keystroke

#IDEA: blog about this system

(I should make it clear here that IDEAs are always parenthetical.
We're still under the aegis of the PROGRESS tag above).  (Just
checked--yep, I meant aegis).

#IDEA: buy a moleskine notebook

To insert a datestamp, I'll need to:

It looks like I want (insert (format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d %T")).  Can
run-in buffer, and it works.  Over to file:~/.emacs

#IDEA: bring in hippie-expand

First attempt:

#IDEA: I can't work Emacs Control-space out of my system.
-- I should use control-space for completion in Eclipse, and Opt-Space
-- for Quicksilver

#IDEA: Emacs doesn't automatically move --'s to next line
-- So maybe just indenting makes it OK?  Does that work?

#IDEA: Get more diaper ointment for Isaac

(defun insert-time-stamp ()
  (interactive)
  (insert (format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d %T")))

(global-set-key "C-xt" 'insert-time-stamp)

#IDEA: F6 kills current buffer

Turns out that key combo should be "\C-x".  Trying again:

2007-07-15 00:36:01

Better.  But shouldn't it insert the "NOW" too?  Yes, I think so

#NOW 2007-07-15 00:37:08

Beautiful.  Where were we?

#Done Insert datestamp with Emacs keystroke
#idea keystroke to pull "active task"

Two things.  First, to behind in a goal means being worse off than you
were 24 hours ago.  This makes things easier.  Second, techically, the
goal was dishes, and I now have a project to bring it up to snuff,
since the goal simply says it doesn't get worse.  Actually, let's
change the definition of Dishes a bit

#PROGRESS Dishes

Dishes is now the number of loads (by estimate) not put away so

#track Dishes 2
#nextStep Dishes wait until 1:20am

#edit Dishes DishLoads
#track DishLoads 2

I am super tired.  Things I think I need to get done before going to
bed:

#idea: When does Nana get in?
#idea: What to say to Mike?
#idea: How to handle morning?
#idea: pay rent
#idea: check Verizon Wireless bill
#idea: check student loan

#startTask When does Nana get in?
Go to Becca's mail, and find out:

Got it

#done When does Nana get in?

#startTask What to say to Mike?

It was good talking to him two weeks ago.  I had been really excited
about moving forward, but two things came up:

#idea Mike Ernst knows what's going on

- I ended up putting a lot of time into the OOPSLA submissions, and
  recovering from that

- We put a lot of time into the next release of JUnit

Now, I want to get going with a two-person two-technique trial, using
JUnit and JUnit Factory.  Is that still a possibility?  I have not yet
thought about the schedule for the rest of the time to the ICSE
deadline.  Hopefully there's room for more studies and more tools.
Can I do better than hopefully?  Maybe, but not tonight.

#idea: when is the ICSE deadline?

#idea: find notes from last meeting with Mike

- Leave house at 8:25
- Get there by 9
- Leave by 9:30?
- If Mike's said yes, try to get to MIT by 10.

#done What to say to Mike?

#idea Tell Marat about tomorrow

#startTask pay rent

Go to citizensbank.com.  Pay to Miranda Callahan.  Done.

Add iCal reminder: e-mail to me.  Way too easy.  Check whether this
works...

Set a task "It's noon!" for noon tomorrow, slated to go off 12 hours
in advance.  Let's see if I get a mail at midnight.

#idea do iCal e-mail reminders work?

Actually, this is silly: can I just cue up the last payment now?  OK,
I set a payment for August 15, with confirmation number 3DRS5Y.

#done pay rent

#startTask check student loan

#idea make sure loan is paid on 21st

It looks like I have EDA turned on, and debit is on the 21st of each month.

#startTask check Verizon Wireless bill

Go to verizonwireless.com

OK, so my number had:

Share Plan: 535
Promo (nighttime): 253
IN Calling: 373

Becca had:

SharePlan: 323
Promo (nighttime): 288
IN Calling: 343

SharePlan minutes = 535 + 323 = 858 = 700 + 158

Where did those minutes come from?

It turns out I spent 177 minutes with Homebin that month.  It included
the closing, so I guess I can't complain.  But the overage ($78.73)
should be figured a cost of closing, not of the cell plan.

#endTask check Verizon Wireless bill

#startTask pre-order Harry Potter

Should come July 21

#endTask pre-order Harry Potter

#startGoal SleepDiff

This is a maintenance goal.  The measure is the number of hours slept
in the second half of the measurement period minus the first half.

#NOW 2007-07-16 00:40:42
#track SleepDiff 0

#startTask Good night sleep tonight

Going to bed.  I feel like I need to sit here and decompress, but I
don't.  I need to go to bed so that I can net better than 4 hours
sleep tonight.  I feel some sexual needs: likewise, not as important.






























#NOW 2007-07-16 09:46:17

I feel good that I went to bed reasonably last night, with just a tad
too long reading before turning in.  I didn't manage to get up at 5
this morning, so I didn't pray.  I'll need to keep working on that.
Right now, I think that my primary slate of priorities is:

- Dishes goal
- Neat house goal
- Clean house project
- Sleep goal

#track DishLoads 2
#nextStep DishLoads go home
#nextStep MessyRooms go home

#progress Good night sleep tonight

Last night, we'll say 4.5 hours of sleep.  On these delta tasks, I
think the most reasonable thing to do is to build to where we can
split by days.  The middle day doesn't count. There's two days on the
table, then:

- Yesterday: 0 hours
- Today: 4.5 hours

#track SleepDiff: +4.5

#done Good night sleep tonight

#NOW 2007-07-16 09:53:45

OK, I think I'm ready to get to work.  First goal:

#startGoal AgitarHoursAhead

So, this assumes that I work 8 hours Monday, 8 hours Thursday, and 4
hours Friday.  (9-5, 9-5, 9-1)  As this time goes by, I need to log
time in iCal.

#idea Bring headphones when working in Borders

So,

#track AgitarHoursAhead 0

#startTask Work this morning

OK, first I should check on Marat.  Is it worth the money to connect?
It is to me.  Let's connect.

#idea check on Treo

Using tmobile.  MacBook is hard to type on on a cafe table.

#idea How to use MacBook ergonomically on a table.

#idea find a HotSpot downtown

#idea Can I use Treo as mobile Internet?

OK, pinged Marat.  Now, to add both and either to the JUnit distro

#idea reduce TODO's in JUnit

#idea a single place to get my familiar templates

#idea remove TODO in SubstringMatcher

I've finished both and either.  Unfortunately, they need to go more
general to more specific.  For example,

both(is(Integer.class)).and(is(3)) works, but
both(is(3)).and(is(Integer.class)) does not.  Darn

Moving on to finishing the release notes.  From here on out, always
release notes first!  

#idea Google search should be default for text
#idea Quicksilver appends ideas here.

OK, so I can't use cvs2cl right now, since it will take longer to
download than I have, and I actually don't want to keep paying
TMobile.  So, moving on...

I should review the text I've written so far.  After that, I should
start looking for bugs in JUnit, but before I could do that, I'd have
to install JUnit Factory, and I don't want to spend a ton of time
online with oly 30 minutes left.  So should I start a play program
using Theories?  Might not be a bad idea.  Theory Explorer?  Yep.

OK, finished the review.  On to theory explorer.

It would be great to have JUnit Factory hooked up before getting too
excited about Theory Explorer.  It would also be great to have
coverage information before jumping in with a JUnit bug hunt. So, how
about nailing some TODOs in JUnit before leaving?

#NOW 2007-07-16 14:05:44

Home.  Boys in bed for another 40 minutes or so.  The most important
thing I need to do now is figure out when the cleaners are coming
tomorrow.  How the heck am I supposed to do that?

More to the point, how does this fit into The System?  Well, let's see
how our goals are doing.

Here's what I was thinking about writing:

OK, hold on a minute.  It's after 4pm.  I should wake Isaac up.
Although I didn't have to wake him up this morning.  Which means I
should now--he's getting enough sleep at night.  I'll have to write my
blog post later.

Isaac isn't waking up anytime soon.  Anyway, here was my thought:

The ad-hoc nature of this strategy is beginning to catch up with me.
I'd love to be able to put DishLoads, for example, out of my mind
until the very moment that I need to deal with it, but it's not easy
to do that right now.

What are the things that I could be doing to get ready for my meeting
with Marat?

- Find old agenda, to figure out who to contact
- Agenda for meeting with Mike
- Contact potential case study participants
- Roadmap to publishing JUnit 4.4
- Publish JUnit 4.4
- Update experimental design
- Schedule time for this week
- Try out case study myself
- Plan for building new tools

OK, so first I'll find that old agenda.

I'm trying out the case study myself.  I wish I'd done this days
ago--the internal signal of inadequacy is screaming at me right now.

The first thing I notice is that it's hard to look at poorly-designed
code looking for bugs.  So:

- Question for before and after survey: how would you rate, from 1 to
  10, the design quality of the code you're examining today?

I've extracted two methods and inserted two more design-related TODO
comments

I'm switching to just TODO comments and tests now.  I need to stop at
10:04

One design flaw had to be fixed just to write the test

Summary.  In 30 minutes, I examined:

LoqBook: 234 lines
Glinda: 55 lines?

Total of 289 lines.  I need to keep track of what is inspected.

I noted eight design flaws, and wrote one bug-revealing test.

#NOW 2007-07-23 10:07:33

Let's try the junit factory way, on JUnit itself.  Will that work?

#NOW 2007-07-23 10:21:36

OK, I've uploaded everything to JUnit Factory.  This is up-front cost
that we should note, but keep out of the tally, I think.  Well, we
should note it, and then decide what to do with it.

Examining tests on Assume.

I get distracted while files are uploading

Tried it on everything in junit.framework.  I think some don't work
because junit factory is using them natively.

Examining tests on ComparisonCompactor

I tend to just skip straight to the tests on public methods that throw
exceptions.  I can't say that this is best.

Examining JUnit4TestAdapterCache: nothing interesting

ResultMatchers: likewise

FailureList: null pointer exception

Can we capture how much time developers spend examining the code
vs. other activities?  We can ask, to start.

OK, all done with my 30 minutes.  In this case, I looked at 5
classes. I found 4 bugs, all minor.  Only one design note.

#NOW 2007-07-23 11:06:10

So JUnitFactory can find problems with parameter checking in my
constructors.  The other approach's benefit came in the inspection
process, not in the fact that there were JUnit tests at the end of
it.  As a matter of fact, I suspect that writing initial theories
would have had the same effect.  So then, what do I need to know?

#NOW 2007-07-24 06:56:01

I'm going to work on the glinda code some more, so that waits will
work.  I hope the boys sleep.

The temptations are running very high.  I'm stressed that I haven't
planned to visit Kevin, stressed that the visit to the house tonight
will not go well, that my meeting with Marat will not go well, that
there will be no ICSE paper, that I will lose my job.  And I just
found out that more than one diet soda a day can cause metabolic
syndrome.  I'm tired, and worried, and behind.

Is there anything I can do in the next 30 minutes that would improve
my meeting with Marat?  I talked to Mike, and we agreed that there is
a problem with the experimental set up so far: if the test developers
are allowed to look at the code, the JUnit-only team will spend more
time on inspection, I believe, and this will swamp any benefits to be
determined among the other techniques.  One possibility is to remove
any temptation to look at the code--just look at either the manual
tests already written, or the tests generated by JUnit Factory, and
use those to build out either more tests or more theories.

Why can I just not get excited about this?  Would I be best off taking
a nap, or a shower, or both?  Quite possibly.  I'm tempted to resort
to my old temptations, but I don't know that I ever feel nearly as
confident afterward.

and if the inspection reveals anything bad, he's ready to bolt.  This
is bad for us, and especially for me--if Becca feels that Nathan is
coming between her and her dream home, there's gonna be disaster, and
it's going to be up to me to mediate it.  Given how well I did between
Becca and Dana, this would not be a positive turn of events.

Nathan is going to want to pave all the way back.  What is the next

I'm feeling very stuck and scared about getting these OOPSLA things
in, and also about somehow recovering some sort of research momentum
after our disastrous previous week.

I believe that for the Demo, I now need to submit a two-page paper.
For the poster, I believe I've already written two pages, but I'm not
even sure if the poster was accepted.

And now our router appears to be down.

I'm getting really stuck on the OOPSLA Theory demo camera-ready copy.  

Things I might want to expand on: I think the idea in the abstract
about "worrying" is a great point to expand on: if developers were
great at looking at and thinking about their code and deciding whether
it had the desired behavior, we'd never have to write tests in the
first place.  Writing tests only for a few scenarios assumes that
developers are great at looking at their code and determining that
there are no unexpected paths, which is the same skill we're assuming
they don't have.

I don't talk about design by contract at all.

Do I give Tillman and Schulte enough credit?

Auto-creation of stubs

Situations in which theories work well:
- Identities
- Data conversion
- General allowed behaviors
- Inconsequential data
- Intention
- Stub-style collaboration

Tests are good for partial specs, theories for more complete specs.

Watching out for duplication in Theories.

I'm talking to Marat in 40 minutes.  First on the table is getting the
case study restarted.  Last week, the problem was that inspecting the
code, which had to be done in the manual JUnit case, seemed to swamp
the other techniques in the number of issues found.  In the end, what
I want is a test suite that is closer to the ideal test suite--it
finds bugs that I had not considered before, but that now seem
likely.  How do I determine which bugs are likely?  I look at the
code.  This seems reasonable for developers--either they have just
written the code, or understanding it appears to be a high priority.
The alternative is preventing anyone from looking at the code, but
this could be a problem if the test suite is already weak.

So, then, the team members get a certain amount of time just to scan
through the code and note doubts (if possible, we'd like those
notes).  Then they can begin using dynamic feedback--any of the four
techniques earlier discussed.

This should work.  I should try it out myself first, but I don't have
time just yet.  Hopefully soon.

The second thing is that either Marat, or someone he works with,
should write a Theory.

Getting a contractor has several components.  We'd like to get three

says that if the work is to begin mid-September, he'd be interested.
First, we need to get flooring in.  This is actually a separate job.

So manually messing with the backlog is getting annoying.  I'm tempted
by the idea that moving things into milestones is a lot like
"bucketizing" ideas in glinda.  Differences:

- Backlog entries may have different time estimates
- Backlog milestones have timeboxes
- It might be nice to have things automatically slide from one timebox
  to the next.  On the other hand, having to explicitly move things
  down might aid thinking about things

Why am I so hung up?  Let's just do this.  On the other hand, I

Here's the thought: there's two things going on in a backlog.  First,
each of my ideas might be to the benefit of one or more parties.
Second is the idea of a milestone chain.  Each node in the chain has a
name, and each node knows who the nodes before and after are.  There's
also time commitments between each node.  There's also time estimates
on ideas.  Interestingly, this could also work for a money budgeting
system, but let's not get ahead of ourselves.  That's more than two
things going on.  There's also the fact that these ideas still belong
to the standard buckets: if something important needs to be done for
Agitar today, I still want it in the "day" bucket.

Transcript of kids playing:

Can I have some bread, too?

Sure, I'd like to.

Now that you know my menu, can you get that done?  See you Toby!

See you!

Go make the soup and bread!

Sure!

OK, guys...

It's bread and soup!

You don't need to go.  I don't need to go [musically]

Go go go!

Why?

Sand in my ear.

Mummy mummy mummy...

Is this the car?  Bye bye, train!

You're Toby.  I'm Schronk!

You climb with me?

I'm white.

You're white?

Yeah, and I'm Doc.  And I'm Schronk.

And white?

Doc, Shronk, and White.

This is Doc, Shronck.  Say Schronk.

Schronk!

What?

Schronk!

What?

Schronk!

I'm Doc!

Schronk!

I'm Schronk.  Oh no, why did you push me down [tortured, a la melting Wicked Witch]

No way!

No way!  You do not.

Where's... I jump!  Watch, Nana.

Not right there, you're going to fall.  FALL!!!!!

Rah.  I fall again.

Follow where?

There.  On the floor.

OK, park with me.  Park, if you're coming.  Do you know what I'm
saying?  You need to park, is what I'm saying.

Yeah.  Green light go.

You have to park by the park.  Oh yeah, you gotta park [music]  I'm
the steam engine, and I park right here.  If you need to park, just
call me and I show you a place to park.  Oh YEAH! [musically]

I spin and spin.

See ya!

See ya!

Bye!

Bye!

Doo doo doo [musically] doo...

Go!  Doo doo doo [musically]

We love the brother staindies [pronunciation confirmed].  We love the
train.  A personal sky.  First act.  We love trains [singing].  We
love trains and sharks.  The brothers team [talking]

[Singing] Brother train!

Sharks and fish... and trains.

Daddy?  Because the train goes on the railroad crossing, and the
lights are blinking.  The lights are blinking.

We loove trains, we love trains

[in stereo]  But the trains are Lego

We love top secret adventures, 95 LP.

No, we're number one.

We love trains and fish [singing]

[humming]

And planes.  And deserts. [singing]  And mysterious things on our
Earth.

I want to listen to OK Go!

That includes the Brother team.  And the brother stamps.  And the
brother staindy.  A staindy of one of the brother staindy members is
OK Go.

Daddy, I listen to OK Go!  Right now.  Ok Go, Daddy, OK Go right now.
Daddy?  Can I see OK Go please?

And thus we're done.

I'll be meeting with Mike in 26 minutes.  How can I use this time to
maximize the value of the meeting?

- Give Mike a realistic view of whether we'll be submitting to ICSE.
- Give Mike a realistic view of how progress toward user studies is
  going.
- Tell Mike about new implementations (Diabol, categories)?

Praying.

Lord,

This morning, I feel ashamed.  I am fat.  I could have done much more
to help with family camp.  I could have done much more to be ready to
meet with Marat on Monday.  I have failed to get Becca the kitchen she
wanted.  I continually fail to take appropriate responsibility as
husband and father in this family.  I constantly cry out for Becca's
approval, when I should seek yours.  Under much more stressful
conditions, endured for much more righteous reasons, Paul kept the
faith--I have abandoned it so many times.  As recently as yesterday I
eagerly sought out my old sexual temptations, a foreign God to whom I
so often turn to help instead of you.

I am sorry.  I want to, right now, start a new path.  Today, Paul says
"judge nothing before the appointed time".  The time to determine
whether or not I am a failure has not yet come.  The jury is still
out.  My choices in the next instant are as important as yesterday's,
or last year's.

I would love to end today feeling that I had been responsible with
what I ate.  I would like to be positive, secure in your blessings,
and use that security to encourage others.

I'd like Becca to have a chance to read her Bible, as well.  She's
been so tired lately.

I thought that we were supposed to bring coffee for the early-morning
coffee time.  Becca believes there's still coffee down at the mess
hall.  Originally, I gave in because she's Becca, and I always give in
to her.  But she's right--Kris didn't say that there specifically
wouldn't be mess hall coffee, and it would be more confusing to people
if there were coffee in both places.

Thank you for every way that you help me,

   David

John's quote for an "easy" washer/dryer hook-up is $1575.  Michael at
Allen Plumbing says that sounds reasonable.  Originally, we were
thinking it would be less than $1000.  We need a washer and
dryer--it's an important part of being our family.  There's really no
reason to have Michael do it--it's not going to be a lot less money,
and John can do it tomorrow.  We could get another estimate--do I
believe it will come in much less?  What are the real odds here?

If I could get a third quote, it would be great.

Using the Bible Gateway verse of the day as a starting point, I'll
start today reading in Isaiah 46.

"The images that are carried about are burdensome, a burden to the
weary".  I certainly feel burdened right now, Lord.  It's going on
three hours since I talked to Mike, and I still don't have a single
word checked in.  I told him that I have done case studies that I
really haven't done.  Why do I keep trying to cover for myself?  Why
not just be honest?

Marat's around.  He'll be wanting to talk in about 20 minutes.  That
will be more time gone.  You said that your yoke was easy, and your
burden was light.  Does this mean it's time to just let go of the
paper?  Or to just let go of trying to seem more done than I am?

Where do my burdens come from?  First, I really want to submit to
ICSE, and I'm worried I'll miss it.  Second, I really want Marat and
Mike, and he reviewers, to think I'm cool, and right now, I feel like
an idiot.  Third, I'm worried that there is a way that I could get
everything done, but the kids and Becca and Mom will be hurt by
it--even worse, there's a way that I might not get enough done on
time, but the kids would still get hurt.  Fourth, I've basically lied
to Mike, and I would feel both stupid and guilty if he found out.
Fifth, deep down I'm pretty sure that I could be working more
efficiently--for example, I could have not answered my mail, or not be
messing with my glinda list, or not praying right now, but I am.

First, if it would destroy your plan for my life for me not to submit
to ICSE, then the submission will be made.  Really what I'm asking, if
I ask you to guarantee we get a good submission made, is protection
from pain, especially pain that results in large part from my own
actions.  I don't want to feel guilty anymore.  Let's face it.  If I
could have come up with a way not to need Glinda just to get my work
done, I'd be much further along now.  I think that experimenting with
Glinda was the right choice.  However, if I really believe that, why
am I hiding its existence from Marat and Mike?  Because I know that it
was not the right way to go--it was big toolmaking up front, instead
of little toolmaking along the way.  If I would feel ashamed publicly
asking for help on a project, I should not be doing it.

I don't know if I feel better.  I feel that I need your forgiveness,
but I'm not sure if what I really need is forgiveness from Marat and
Mike.  Help me.

   David

Just chatted Marat to see what's going on.

Just Talked to Marat.  He will work on the input generation part of
the paper.

#NOW 2007-09-10 14:30:41
I'm chatting Kent now to see if he ever wrote anything about Why
Theories Are Cool.

#NOW 2007-09-10 15:09:14
Kent did, but only on paper.  He wrote that DbC took things too far in
the universal direction, but JUnit took things too far back in the
existential direction.

So I have Marat working on input generation section, and myself
working on the main text.  I could also log a bug for SortedBag, to
see if that gets anywhere.

So Mike's waiting on my next draft.  Marat is, too.  I'm waiting on
feedback from the Collections people (until tomorrow afternoon
sometime), and an input-generation chapter from Marat (also sometime
tomorrow afternoon).  I've just sent Mike svn information, so his
corrections should be coming in soon.  I think that Mike's info might
really shape the way forward, especially if he has it compiling, so
more case study work may make sense for me.

I need to have some more ideas around Time and Money in order not to
be a complete liar.  

#idea Try old TopCoder problems

#NOW 2007-09-10 22:32:36

Haven't heard back from Mike.  I'll have to send something to Marat
soon.  Marat wanted an outline, so that's something I can work on.
I'm waiting on Mike to respond whether he has content changes.

Earliest sunrise in Arlington is 5:07.  This is my new wake-up time.

#idea Get more sleep if I don't wake up before alarm.

I'm talking about within 10% of what appears to be my best
HoursSlept.  That's currently almost 3.  30% of an hour is 18
minutes.  So if I wake up anytime after 4:49, I need to get up.  And
out to the porch.  I can take a nap at any time it seems OK, and don't
need to set an alarm, unless I need to be somewhere.

What to say in blog post?

If the whole story of the summer were to be told, we'd keep you up all
night.  Let a few words suffice for now, and we'll try to fill in the
gaps later.

We spent the summer in Harvard Square.  It's hip.
Alex was our nanny.  He's awesome.
Becca started residency.  It's challenging, and often rewarding.
We visited St. Louis, Chicago, Maine, the Cape, and Connecticut.  We saw
family, family, trees, friends, and friends.  Hello, all!
Isaac's going potty.  He's excited.
We moved to Arlington.  It's excellent.
We're still waiting for our neightbors.  See you soon!
God is good.  More to come.

Starting now to spike on ICSE paper.  Mike's waiting on a "draft" from
me.  Marat is waiting on a better outline from me.  Kevin wants to
know if I've tried the latest Eclipse.  Henri Yandell has confirmed
that my SortedBag bug is a bug.

I can ask Carlos about his bug.  I can submit a bug to Time and
Money.  I can submit a bug to Jetty.

It turns out there's no need to ask Carlos: it's right there in his
ICSE paper.  I can figure out what's going wrong with the Eclipse JDT,
and complain about it.

OK, Time and Money bug is submitted.

which is different than what I intended to ask.  If I ask Marat for
more content on Leitner's stuff, we'll be in good shape.

Back to the ICSE paper.  My Jetty question is out there until
tonight.  My Time and Money bug is out there.  I've asked Marat for
more about Leitner's work.  My team is working.

First, I'll scan mail for quick wins.

#NOW 2007-09-12 10:00:17
Still feel like I'm floundering a bit.  What are the things I know
that are not in the paper?

- Carlos's bug
- Time and Money is a real bug, and a nice example
- I believe, Theories as a way to use sophisticated tools with simple
  contracts (which I've written elsewhere)
- Collections is a real bug
- Ways of representing specifications as tests
- Patterns of using Theories

Once these are in, one read-through should do it.

MessyRooms is a bit much: having to walk the whole house before
cleaning any room seems annoying.  So, the key will be to assume that
all rooms less important than the most important messy room are
messy.  Room importance:

A quick chat with George Lucey.  Now Bible reading

#NOW 2007-09-13 09:04:23
OK, messing with Firefox.  Now reading.

Good morning, Lord.

I'm more tired this morning than I expected to be.  The first hour or
so of writing this morning were excellent.

The paper now has at least eight pages, but some of those are still
junk.  I think that by the end of tomorrow, it can be a decent paper,
but it still needs help.  I'm hoping that Mike and Marat put a lot of
time into it, as well.  An ICSE paper would be an excellent boost to
my entire career, I believe.

I want to feel more excited about getting back to work on it, but I'm
dragging.  I love Titus 3--this is an absolutely excellent basis for
life.

"Remind the people to be subject to rulers and authorities, to be
obedient."  "to be ready to do whatever is good".  This is an
excellent thing to expand on.  Not just to do whatever is good, but
"be ready to do whatever is good".  What could this mean?

- Have gifts on hand ready to send to people who need them
- Put aside slack time that can be devoted to helping people at the
  last minute.  Gift time--not committed to anything.  I actually like
  this a lot.

#idea Plan "gift time"

"to slander no one"  "to be peaceable and considerate"  "and to show
true humility toward all men"

#idea Memorize Titus 3

"At one time we too were foolish, disobedient, deceived and enslaved
by all kinds of passions and pleasures"  "We lived in malice and envy,
being hated and hating one another"

test classes, on the way to fixing Glinda.




































#idea Call Maria Bradley re babysitter for Tuesday

Palms have gone for 

255.00 + shipping
341.01 + shipping, and 
167.50 + 15 = 170.00.  I don't know the
shipping, so can't mess with the sig figs.  If I can get another for
167.50, we'll be home free.



#NOW 2007-09-23 22:24:05
Placed a Treo bid.  We'll see how this goes.

Mountain buggies have sold for 640 + shipping, 515 + shipping, and
486.99 + 50 = 536.99.

As far as I know, glinda is still broken.  I need to stop running
against a working copy.  

#idea Stop running against working copy of glinda

I'm going to meet with Mike in 68 minutes.  I need to involve him in
one key goal.  I believe that that goal should be to get users.  I
also should ask about TAP, ISSTA, the rest.

Talked to Carlos.  Glad he's getting through it.  I need a thesis
proposal.  Should that be my focus with Mike?  Yes, it's what he can
give the most feedback on.

Test Factoring
Theories paper

First, what is the third paper that pulls these together, and builds
upon CT?

#NOW 2007-09-24 11:02:14

Back to fixing Glinda

Need to respond to Kevin about wrapping tests (clean out junk mail
while we're at it)

Adding Treos I've lost:

255.00 + shipping
341.01 + shipping, and 
167.50 + 15 = 170.00.  
200.00 + 19.99 = 219.99
212.50 + 10.00 = 222.50

So the median cost is 222.50  Shipping on next phone is 15, so max bid
is 207.50.  Currently winning...

I've tried twice to post this to Craig's List, and messed up with photos both times.  Here's my third try:

Gas Stove in Excellent condition
250
Arlington, MA

This is a Kenmore stove in excellent condition.  If the size and color
fit our renovated kitchen, we'd keep it.  It came with our house, but
I imagine it's less than ten years old.  We'd like the space back, so
we're flexible on price and delivery if you act quickly.

Features include movable oven racks, warming tray, four burners,
preheat notification, and a digital clock/timer/temperature control.

#NOW 2007-10-09 21:04:09

Commit message:

- Simplified Theory code by assuming that all datapoints are static
  (every one I've ever written is)

- Removed EachTestNotifier from Assignments (makes the class more
  cohesive, but requires the notifier to get passed around a bunch.
  TODO added to look at this.)

- Extracted AllMembersSupplier, absorbed AssignmentRequest into
  Assignments.  Better cohesion, less coupling

- EachTestNotifier.withNewInstance is no longer needed.  It was a
  nasty little beast and will not be missed.

- Added comment to ErrorList TODO

- Added TestMethod.getTestClass--will probably change in upcoming
  model package revamp anyway

#NOW 2007-10-10 11:32:53

Made Link unable to throw exception.  The score:

LOSERS:

- Theories got more complicated, but it's possible this pushes it
  further toward being Link-based, which I'd like

- ExpectedException: slightly more complicated

- IgnoreTest / Notifying: now need to take in EachTestNotifier, but
  the advantage is that it's now explict that they're the only ones
  that use the full power of that.

- Invoke: absorbs complexity from elsewhere

was

	public void run(EachTestNotifier context) throws Throwable {
		fTestMethod.invokeExplosively(fTarget);
	}

is

	public void run(FailureListener listener) {
		try {
			fTestMethod.invokeExplosively(fTarget);
		} catch (Throwable e) {
			listener.addFailure(e);
		}
	}

WINNERS:

- JUnit4ClassRunner

was

    try {
    	chain(method, test).run(context);
    } catch (StoppedByUserException e) {
    	throw e;
    } catch (Throwable e) {
    	throw new RuntimeException("Unexpected error running tests", e);
    }

is

    chain(method, test, context).run(context)

- Notifying

was

	context.fireTestStarted();
	try {
		fNext.run(context);
	} catch (Throwable e) {
		context.addFailure(e);
	} finally {
		context.fireTestFinished();
	}

is

	fNotifier.fireTestStarted();
	fNext.run(listener);
	fNotifier.fireTestFinished();

- WithBeforeAndAfter can now use JavaElement, eliminating earlier
  duplication

- WithTimeout

was

	try {
		fNext.run(context);
	} catch (Exception e) {
		throw e;
	} catch (Error e) {
		throw e;
	} catch (Throwable e) {
		// TODO: (Oct 5, 2007 11:27:11 AM) Now what?  Is there a useful thing to do with this?
	}

is

	fNext.run(listener);

OK, so I've screwed up velocity.  The idea is supposed to be that if I
usually do something every three days, and it's been three days since
I've done it, I should do it again.  Perhaps that's the answer.
However, for things like sleeping, that I usually do every day for
multiple "points", I don't want it figuring that I usually sleep once
every eight hours or so.  If I've done something in the last 24 hours,
then the current system works.  If not, I need to figure it based on
the last positive track.  So it's 24 hours ago, if there's been a
positive track since, or 24 hours since the last positive track, that
is the comparison.  So one test would be:

(t0)
t1: 1
t2: 2
t3: [imaginary end point]
t4: 
t5: now.

We compare the velocity at t3 (3/3 = 1.0).  We should be 2 behind now,
sice we were pulling one a day.  Let's try it.

George Lucey says that Ethan should become an engineer.  He's very
deliberate in the way he explains things.

Ethan is watching a train video.  I wish it wasn't going on so long
while I try to get things together here, but it's better than a lot of
things he could be doing.  He's very emphatic in how he describes
things: "I just can't do it.  I'm sorry, Daddy, but it will have to be
a long time.  I wish you could see this part.  It's just amazing!"

Today at lunch, Ethan just couldn't get enough green pasta.  So Isaac
wandered off to play with trains, and Ethan and I talked.  Without
being really sure what to talk about, I pulled out stories about when
I was Ethan's age.  I talked about preschool at Grace Church United,
told him I grew up in St. Peters, not St. Louis proper.  I told him
about the blocks we had in preschool, and the animals--how we used to
build zoos out of blocks.  I told him that I loved reading books about
animals, and acting out my favorite scenes from the Empire Strikes
Back.  He said that when he's more grown up, he'd like to see that
movie with me.  He told me the same about the Voyage of the Dawn
Treader.  Ethan really is interested in who I am, when I give him the
chance to be.

How to get stuff from Agitar VPN through tunneling:

To see wiki:

sudo ssh -L 80:wiki.in.agitar.com:80 -l david -N knight.agitar.com
Agitar password is d@v1d
Surf to, for example, http://localhost/twiki/bin/view/Agitar/SubversionForDevelopers
Due to hard-coded URL's, many links have to be hand-edited

To get svn:

ssh -L 1234:raptor:80 -l david -N knight.agitar.com
Now, you can surf to http://localhost:1234/repos/
And check things out: svn co http://localhost:1234/repos/build.system/trunk build.system

Now, to get everything:

SVNURL=http://localhost:1234/repos build.system/ant -f build.system/build.xml svn-all-modules

- Poster printed
- Clothes packed
- Computer packed
- Toiletries packed

To leave in the morning, I need:

- Poster ready to print
- Clothes packed
- Computer packed
- Toiletries packed
- Boys packed
  - Clothed
  - Food

I feel too tired to work on the poster right now.  Clothes are in the
washer until alarm goes off.  Strangely, packing lunches seems not too
bad right now.

The adoption rate of theories does not appear to be high.  Quick questions to answer:

- How many downloads of junit 4.4?
- How many of those are legit?
- How many mailing list postings about theories?
- How many about other 4.4-specific features?
- Of JUnit tests, how many are theorizable?

If adoption is truly low, why is this?

- New features take a long time to disseminate?
- Theories are poorly documented?
- Developers don't think in theories?
- Big ideas aren't theorizable?
- Current code isn't theorizable

I had a hard time with Ethan today.  During Isaac's nap, Ethan was
very excited about making a book.  He colored many pages; many of them
very quickly, and used the label printer to print out chapter titles,
which usually included a date--all within the last month, but none of
them today--and a description, such as one of his favorite train
numbers, or "Dinos".

I think that all of us want the house back.

you truncate this log back to "#NOW 2007-11-07 10:30:53", You'll find
that running agitar-backlog requires me to mark things as done while

I could copy just this row over, but going too far seems a good idea
as well.  So, I need to learn how to do MySQL backup and restore, and
then backup, and then restore.

It looks like you back up with

mysqldump --all-databases > all_databases.sql

and restore with

mysql -p --user=username < guestdb.txt

I've bookmarked both pages where I found these.

I woke the boys up at 7 yesterday morning.  Isaac fell asleep in the
stroller at the mall, and then woke up soon before we got
home--probably about an hour.  It was 9:20 or so before Becca left
their room last night, and Isaac generated requests for another 20
minutes at least.  Right now, at 6:03am, they are sleeping soundly
(and have done so all night).

It's 6:14, and the water level 30 minutes ago was right in the middle
of the vertical white stripe on the front of the sight glass.

It's probably only been about 15 minutes since I last heard from
Isaac.  Ethan is very concerned because I accidentally showed him a
screamer video on Youtube--something I will always regret.  But I
think both are now asleep.  No, it turns out Isaac is still awake.
He's hot.  This follows that he's thirsty, needs to go to the
bathroom, needs a snuggle, needs his animals, Ethan's cat had dropped,
etc.  I think the best thing to do is just to reiterate that he needs
to go to sleep, and then leave it at that.  Ethan slept from probably
1:30 to 4 today, Isaac from 2:45 to 4.  I don't know when the boys
woke up--Ethan before Becca had even gotten out of the shower, so
probably about 5:45, and Isaac much later, almost 8.

Isaac didn't sleep at all at naptime yesterday, and neither did
Ethan.  They both went to bed late, since Becca was home and
exciting.

Changes in this check-in:
- Moved InitializationError to ParentRunner, since it was only used by
  subclasses of ParentRunner.
- Broke up TestMethod into FrameworkMethod (which makes it more clear
  that these methods can also be Before, After, etc.), and
  TestAnnotation (for specific information only available on the @Test
  annotation).
- Created TestMethodElement to encapsulate the relationship between
  @Test, @Before, and @After.  This class may go away again quickly
- Updated version in docs to 4.5
- Included docs about junit-dep jar

I woke up both boys yesterday morning about 6:30, as usual for
school.  Both were reasonably good at getting up, probably because
Mommy was there.  No nap yesterday, and a later bedtime--probably not
fully down until after 9.  This morning, Isaac was up at 6:30 needing
to go potty, and Ethan got up about 7:30.  Isaac was really tired and
cranky, Ethan somewhat less so.  After one trip to the potty, Isaac
was asleep by 1:15, really quick.  Ethan's been quiet, but might just
be reading.

Ethan did a great job singing in the 8:30 service today.  He smiled,
projected, did some of the hand motions.  At 11, he sucked his thumb,
and taunted me with sucking his thumb.  On the way home, we talked
about it.  He's not having quiet time now--I've told him that this
week, I promise he won't have to have quiet time, and he has to
promise not to suck his thumb.  We'll see how that goes.

Both boys went to sleep super late last night--possibly as late as
10.  Both were up well before 6:30--Isaac saying that he's hungry.  We
need to get that boy an evening snack.  Yesterday afternoon, Ethan had
no official quiet time for the first time.  He did great through the
afternoon, and then got really cranky for some of the evening--having
a great time the rest of the time.  Isaac took a big nap yesterday as
well--at least two hours.  Isaac laid down with Becca at about 1:30
today, and pretty quickly fell deeply asleep.  I wouldn't be surprised
if they both sleep until 4 or later.

Run Different: Extending JUnit 4 with Custom Runners

<p>
Custom Runners are the primary means of extending JUnit 4.  A custom
runner can do anything from adding an extra check to the end of each
test method, to running tests written in a different test framework
(like TestNG) or a different language (like Ruby, or a completely new
domain-specific language).  Custom runners automatically get tight
integration with Eclipse, Ant, and other JUnit-4-aware development
tools. In addition, custom runners can make use of
JUnit's little-known test prioritization and filtering capabilities.
</p>

The talk will first demonstrate JUnit's built-in runners for
parameterized data and unit theories (general statements evaluated
against specific examples).  It will then review custom runners written by
third parties, including JMock's runner, the CPSuite runner for
automatically finding JUnit test classes, and the JRSpecRunner for
running RSpec tests written in Ruby.
</p>

<p>
Finally, audience members will learn the Custom Runner API as we write
together a new custom runner that runs many JUnit tests in parallel
threads.

Theory-infected: Or How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Use Unit Theories in JUnit 4

<p>
  Writing developer tests as software is built can provide peace of mind.  As
  the software grows, running the tests can prove that everything still works
  as the developer envisioned it.  But what about the behavior the developer
  failed to envision?  Although verifying a few well-picked scenarios is often
  enough, experienced developers know bugs can often lurk even in well-tested
  code, when correct but untested inputs provoke obviously wrong responses.
  This leads to worry.
</p>

<p>
  JUnit now allows writing unit <em>theories</em> alongside unit tests, to
  specify desired universal behaviors.  For example, when writing a
  date and time library, we can write a theory stating that adding an
  hour to any TimePoint produces a later time:

<pre>
	@Theory
	public void laterDateIsAfter(GlindaTimePoint a) {
		assertThat(a.plus(hours(1)), after(a));
	}
</pre>
</p>

<p>
  We will demonstrate how writing theories
  affects test-driven development, how new features in JUnit can verify
  theories against hand-picked inputs, and how a new tool, Theory Explorer,
  can search for new inputs, leading to a new, less worrysome approach to
  development.
</p>

resisted nap time for quite some time, and finally fell asleep close
to 2:30, and then woke up spontaneously a little after 4.  We went
shopping way to late last night, and I don't think the boys were in

The purpose of the user study is to evaluate three hypotheses:

1) Once trained in the use of unit theories, developers will find ways
to use it in testing their code.

2) Developers will enjoy using unit theories.

3) Developers will report learning new things using unit theories

We started bathtime about 7:30 last night, so the kids must have gone
to bed soon after.  We got them up at 6:30am, and it was a really
cranky struggle.  Yesterday afternoon, Isaac fell asleep on the way
home in the car, probably about 2pm, and didn't wake up until almost
5pm.  He had a hard time going to sleep last night.  I think that no
matter what, naptime has to end at 4pm.

Yesterday, Ethan slept in until 10am.  Isaac woke up about 6, and
Becca claims he never really went back to sleep, although he seemed
very asleep when I woke up around 8.

Sunday, I don't know what time the boys woke up, since they spent the
night with Nana and Papa.  Neither napped.  They fell asleep on the
airplane, sometime probably around midnight our time, and slept mostly
through until the morning, although both woke up crankily in the
airport.

Yesterday, I had to wake up both boys at 6:30, but they popped up
pretty quickly, and were out the door without much trouble.  Last
night, they seemed to be exhausted, and both were having trouble
making good decisions.  They were in bed by 8:30ish.  Isaac woke up at
4:30 and again at 4:55, needing a snuggle both times, and finally
falling back asleep.  Ethan woke up around 7:45, and Isaac at 9.  Both
seem to be in good spirits.  OK, maybe Isaac not so much--he's
stretched out both breakfast and going potty incredibly long.

Yesterday, Isaac really wanted to climb in the big construction
climber at the children's museum, which claims it is only for ages 5
and up.  I knew that once he got up, I couldn't follow him to do the
rest of it, so I told Isaac to have Ethan help him.  Ethan gave him a
leg up, and later Isaac told Becca "I climbed on the climber.  My
brother helped me."

Starting an hour-long spike on workflow now.

The presentation will use four different scenarios to demonstrate four
aspects of software development using Theories in JUnit: finding bugs
in an established code base, automatically generating collaborators,
test-driving development with theories, and verifying specifications
that are hard to express with design-by-contract.

\subsection{Finding bugs in an established code base}

We have found that many well-tested, widely-used libraries have test
suites that appear to be written with a specification in mind.
Individual scenarios are chosen to confirm corner cases of the general
specification, which itself does not appear explicitly in the test
suite, code, or documentation.  We will demonstrate one example of how
explicitly stating the general principle as a Theory not only makes
the intent clearer for future maintainers, but allows the discovery of
existing bugs using Theory Explorer.

Time and Money\footnote{\url{http://timeandmoney.domainlanguage.com/}}
is a library implementing time and currency domains in
a fluent interface based on Domain-Driven Design.\cite{DDD}.
One of its core classes is 
\code{Interval}, which defines a range of values between two endpoints, which
may be inclusive or exclusive.  We will show a a real test that asserts that the
complement of a particular Interval relative to itself is empty:

\begin{Verbatim}
public void testRelativeComplementEqual() {
  Interval c1_7c = Interval.closed(new Integer(1),
                                   new Integer(7));
  List complement = c1_7c.complementRelativeTo(c1_7c);
  assertEquals(0, complement.size());
}
\end{Verbatim}

This is true not only of closed intervals between 1 and 7,
but of any Interval.  We will show how writing this explicitly as a
Theory saves thought and typing:

\begin{Verbatim}
@Theory
public void relativeComplementOfSelfIsEmpty(Interval i) {
  List complement = i.complementRelativeTo(i);
  assertEquals(0, complement.size());
}
\end{Verbatim}

We will show how data points can be manually added to the test suite,
increasing test coverage and developer confidence.  Then, we will use
Theory Explorer to show an unexpected bug found in the wild (reported
in our companion research paper submission to ICSE (\emph{The Practice of
Theories: Adding ``For-all'' Statements to ``There-Exists'' Tests}).

We will argue that expressing specifications in Theories is a small
conceptual jump for developers already accustomed to testing in JUnit.

\subsection{Automatically generating collaborators}

A theory can specify exactly how a component A depends on another
component B, and let B vary in every other dimension.  For example,
consider an air-travel-planning algorithm which depends
PreferenceProvider interface, which may choose between flights based
on schedule, duration, or cost.  For example, this theory states that
if the PreferenceProvider will only consider non-stop flights, only
non-stop flights should be chosen:

\begin{Verbatim}
@Theory
public void nonstopPreference(FlightRequest r, PreferenceProvider p) {
  assumeThat(p.willAcceptLayover(), is(false));

  Plan plan = new Agent().plan(r);
  assumeThat(plan.successful(), is(true));

  assertThat(plan.layoverCount(), is(0));
}
\end{Verbatim}

The default implementation of the PreferenceProvider interface
consults a human through the user interface, but we would like to
avoid requiring a human to participate in every run of the unit tests.
We could construct by hand a stub PreferenceProvider that will provide
the assumed response, but this is repetitive work.  Instead, we will
show how the Diabol theory runner extension automatically generates a
stub for the PreferenceProvider class by iterative refinement.

\subsection{Test-driving development with Theories}

We will quickly show how a roman numeral conversion function can be
written test first, using one theory, a handful of explicit tests for
corner cases, and Theory Explorer to find remaining failing data
points.

\subsection{Theories compared to Design by Contract}

There are some ideas that are as easily expressed in the preconditions
and postconditions of a Design-by-Contract specification as they are
in a Theory.  However, Theories can often be much simpler.

For example, the following
Theory about stacks expresses an obvious relationship between two
mutating methods:

\begin{Verbatim}
@Theory public void pushThenPop(Stack s, Object o) {
  s.push(o);
  assertTrue(s.pop() == o);
}
\end{Verbatim}

Expressing this as preconditions and postconditions would require a
model of the Stack's abstract state, which can be more mental
investment than is possible or necessary.

Thoughts from readthrough:
- Remove OOSPLA copyright
- Uses sounds particularly restricting
- test runner that...
- The data point is added, and the developer chooses what to do with it.

Things missing:
- Preview of finding missing bugs
- Look through implementation section of research submission?
- Custom suppliers
- Diabol
- Infiltration? (xUnit.net)
- Comparison with data-driven tests

Abstract needs to be 50 words.

We suggest writing \vocab{Theories} alongside developer tests, to specify
desired universal behaviors.  New features in JUnit can verify
theories against hand-picked inputs, and a new tool, Theory Explorer,
can search for new inputs, leading to a new, less worrysome approach to
development.

Keywords: Theories, JUnit, testing, partial specification

I started the boys on bath time about 7:35, and they went went pretty
quickly to sleep, considering--Isaac was still awake about an hour
after going down, but asleep soon after that.  Ethan probably only
took 15 minutes.  Both appeared to have colds today.  Ethan may have
taken a nap with Becca.  Isaac fell asleep in the car, probably around
2pm, and woke up a little after 4pm.

This morning had one high point: Ethan got up, knocked on my door, and
crawled up into bed.  I told him I was going to read my Bible, so he
went and found his, and read it, too.  I still need to figure out how
to get our life more organized, so that it's fair to expect him to get
ready in the morning without distraction.

Last night, we started bedtime at 7:30, and it was largely over at
8:15.  However, both boys were up and kicking until 9:45 at least.
This was probably a result of my letting them both nap until well
after 4pm.  The fact is that a 3:30pm end of naptime is probably the
right answer.  We'll try that next.

Ethan and Isaac both woke up before I did today, and I didn't wake up
until after 8am.  (A mistake that ended up hurting Becca).  Isaac woke
up crying in the middle of the night--perhaps his legs were hurting
like before.  Since we went to Friday Night Kids, it's likely that the
boys were not asleep much before 10.  Isaac fell asleep on the way
home from school yesterday on the train, just for a minute.  Everyone
was in a great mood yesterday afternoon, but seemed cranky this
morning.  Part of this is that I'm still learning what to expect from
them.  Isaac is asleep--probably, he was asleep by 1:30.  Ethan is at
the end of his 15 minutes' rest, so I'll need to get him up soon.

Yesterday, we had to kick both boys out of bed at 6:30.  The word from
school was that both were very tired.  We walked around--first through
the common to Starbucks, and then down Beacon to the Athenaeum,
dropping Becca off at MGH.  Isaac fell asleep on the train at about
5:15, and did not wake up again until 6:30, and then only barely.  He
was tired enough to wet his pants, which he hasn't done for a while.
Ethan fell promptly asleep.

This morning, both boys woke up at 7:30--plenty of time to wake Becca
and I up, as well.  We had a late lunch, and went down for nap around
1.  Ethan stayed awake for what turned out to be about 45 minutes.
Isaac must have gone to sleep fairly quickly, but I don't know.  Right
now, at 2:26, Ethan is awake, Becca asleep, and Isaac asleep

OK, so it seems that the best option I have for choosing when to wake
the boys up is to split the difference between the sleep differential
from the previous day and the awake differential.  Yesterday, Isaac
slept from 10 to 6:30--8.5 hours sleep, and then was awake today
until, adjusting for the trip home, 10pm, so 15.5 hours awake.
Tomorrow, he'll go down for nap at 1pm.  If he wakes up at 6:30, the
sleep differential will be 0, and the awake differential will be 9
hours.  According to this idea, getting him up at 6:30 is ideal.

Ethan, on the other hand, slept 10 hours, and awake for 15.5.  The
zero point for him would be 8am--since he'll go to sleep at 8pm,
that's 12 hours awake.

Yesterday, Isaac napped from sometime after 3 until almost 5:30.  Then
we were out ridiculously late at the party, and Isaac wasn't asleep
until almost midnight, Ethan sometime before.  All said, the boys were
great yesterday.  This morning, Isaac was up by 7:15, Ethan closer to
8.  It's 1:19 right now, and the boys are talking instead of resting.

#NOW 2007-12-15 15:10:20 Ethan used legos today to build a garden.
I'm not sure what all of the flowers in the garden were, but the red
block was roses.  He had used a blue block for water, but sadly the
blue block was part of Isaac's Lofty model, and had to be given back.
Ethan collapsed into tears--big, real tears--before I reminded him
that the smaller legos also could be attached to the duplo-sized
legos.

Just now, Ethan wanted to look over my shoulder as I was writing
this.  I told him no, and he launched into a snit, first trying to
move all of his toys into the hallways by Isaac's room, then elling me
that he had to "meet the director of his play", and that I was making
him angry because I was making him late.

This has escalated and escalated, with Ethan talking back to me each
time.  I just spanked him, yelled at him at the top of my lungs, and
put him on the bed in our room indefinitely.  Even then, he talked
back to me.  I currently feel several things.

- This cannot be the solution to the problem.  This doesn't scale to
  14.
- Maybe it does scale to 14.  Maybe when Ethan is 14, he will have bad
  days that have moments like this in the middle, just like we do
  now.  The problem is not that my approach is wrong, just that I
  don't have the backbone to put up with years of it.
- I hate spanking.  Spanking certainly does not scale to 14.  I go to
  spanking in hopes of sparking remorse--just once, I'd like Ethan to
  be sad because he'd made me upset, not just because he'd like to
  have a privilege that I've removed.
- I have to have a right to some time to myself in my own house.
  Ethan cannot get snitty with me just because I fail to jump when he
  says jump.
- I may ask for too much time to myself in my own house.  The kids
  don't necessarily see the difference between me talking to Grandma
  for an hour on the phone and playing video games for an hour--it's
  still time I'm not spending with them.
- The computer is a huge part of the problem.  It's what started all
  of this.  The computer can do anything--the fact that I am really
  trying to use it to organize my life appears to not mean anything--I
  might as well be playing Mario Brothers, because I'm Using The
  Computer--the ultimate Holy Grail.  Heck, Ethan will stare at MY
  DESKTOP IMAGE for minutes, just to absorb the wonder that is The
  Computer.
- Of course, that's part of the problem itself.  This is how I relax.
  I got a computer job and a computer research track because I enjoy
  working on computers.  Part of this is impudence, but part is the
  boys just truly sensing what I already value.  I don't feel like I
  spend too much time in front of the computer.  Perhaps I do?  What
  is the alternative?
- I know what the alternative is--I need to become a better
  homekeeper, have Grocery Tuesdays and Laundry Thursdays, and other
  routines and quick fixes that don't actually require a computer to
  get right.  I'm crappy at these things.
- I had nothing planned for today.  Actually, I had errands and a trip
  to the library planned, but then got caught up in getting ready for
  Christmas, and calling my parents, and wasted possibly the only
  errandable morning for a week.  If I'd been using Glinda, I don't
  think that would have happened, but I can't use Glinda, because that
  means using the computer, which I'm not allowed to do alone.
- I think that the Dr. Pepper is making me irritable.  I've got to
  stop.
- I can't blame Ethan, 4, with not coming up with enough productive
  things to do, when David, 31, is just as bad at coming up with
  them.
- I need to pray.  I really need to pray.  I have to get off my doughy
  white butt, and pray.

So what now?  In terms of ultimate causes, I have to start getting up
earlier than everyone else.  Ironically, I also need to ditch the
soda.  Proximately, Ethan can't talk back to me.  Also ultimately, the
kids need to see Becca and I work together better.  So:

1) Get a better alarm clock
2) Get rid of the soda
3) Work better with Becca
4) Talk to Ethan

I think that the last four nights in a row, Ethan has woken up every

should look up kids with bad dreams.

Basement = 46300
Attic = 15800

46300 + 15800 = 62100
31050

Upstairs has 43.5 more square feet in bedroom + 18 square feet in the front room.

It appears space is valued at about $125/sqft, so this means the main
part of upstairs is worth $7687.50.  According to the assessment, the
downstairs porch was worth $5,200 more than the upstairs porch, but
that should probably be handled with money.  The basement is about 45
x 24 = 1080 sqft.  Nathan claims it's valued at 46300, meaning that
each square foot is worth $42.87.  Actually, we can subtract 12 x 10.5
= 126 sqft, which is the common entrance, worth $5401.67.  That leaves
954 square feet worth $40898.33.  The Swillings have an attic worth,
apparently, $15,800.  This means that currently, just basement to
attic, the Saffs are 25098 ahead.  If we give the Swillings 12,549.16,
we'd be square on basement/attic.  That's 292.73 sqft, which is 24.4
feet of one side.

So I'm going to have two more blogs.  What Doing is perfect.  Share
and Enjoy is too Douglas Adams: I want to be the top google hit on my
own blog name.  I'm probably spawning two blogs here--one for my own
occasional musings, and one for just tech stuff.  Ideas:

1) Testing the Sprites: a deliberate mistype of testing the spirits,
but my work doesn't particularly focus on sprites.

2) tech.david.saff.net: Doesn't add or subtract anything.

3) Language of Demands: This gets into Popper territory.  I think I
have things to offer to programming in this respect, but Google shows
that "Language of Demands" has a negative impact

4) Fail fast: pretty hard to argue with, but maybe not pointing to me
as a person.

5) junit.saff.net: A little too specific, even though most of my work
is Java-based.  I'd like this blog to survive a leap to Ruby, if not
necessarily a jump to artificial intelligence

6) Wooba wooba: I don't like the grover connotation

7) Test Driving: Goes out on a limb, apparently, while still giving
the impression of "test driving" a car.  The second definition is the
only one Google comes up with.

8) Name the page after my eventual company.  This has a big
advantage.  Perhaps shouldbewillbe.com?  This was to be my world-wide
bugzilla page.

9) TOTE, or test operate test exit.  Hard to get high on Google.

10) Some punny variation on test operate test exit
